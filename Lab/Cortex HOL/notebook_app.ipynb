Today, the most common approach for reducing hallucinations without having to change the model (e.g. fine-tuning) is the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. RAG allows you to \"ground\" the model's responses by making a set of relevant documents available to the LLM as context in the response.\n\nIn this quickstart we will show you how to quickly and securely build a full-stack RAG application in Snowflake without having to build integrations, manage any infrastructure or deal with security concerns with data moving outside of the Snowflake governance framework.\n\nWe will show you how easy it is to implement RAG via a chat assistant that knows everything about smart devices. This assistant can be really useful for your not so tech-savvy friend or relative that is always asking you questions about their electronics. To make the assistant an expert in a smart devices, we are going to give it access to a few User Manuals. This template can easily be adapted to other documents that may be more interesting to you whether its financial reports, research documents or anything else!\n\nAlong the way, we will also share tips on how you could turn what may seem like a prototype into a production pipeline by showing you how to automatically process new documents as they are uploaded as well as learn about relevant Snowflake functionality to consider for additional enhancements.\n\n### What You Will Build\n\nThe final product includes an application that lets users test how the LLM responds with and without the context document(s) to show how RAG can address hallucinations.\n\n### What You Will Learn\n\nHow to create functions that use Python libraries using [Snowpark](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/snowpark/?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O)\n\nHow to generate embeddings, run semantic search and use LLMs using serverless functions in [Snowflake Cortex](https://www.snowflake.com/cortex?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O)\n\nHow to build a front-end with Python using [Streamlit in Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/overview/streamlit-in-snowflake/?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O)\n\nOptional: How to automate data processing pipelines using directory tables, [Streams](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O) and [Task](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tasks-intro?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nSnowflake account in a cloud region where Snowflake Cortex LLM functions are supported\n\nCheck [LLM availability](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions?_ga=2.5151286.405859672.1709568467-277021311.1701887324&_gac=1.124754680.1707955750.Cj0KCQiA5rGuBhCnARIsAN11vgRLWfK6RIoIEqcZ7cFas8qwN4yCoL0q9nttp5UEmSocnPmhdBG57fgaAjqNEALw_wcB&_fsi=j2b82Wl3&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O#availability) to help you decide where you want to create your snowflake account\n\nA Snowflake account with [Anaconda Packages](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/udf/python/udf-python-packages?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O#using-third-party-packages-from-anaconda) enabled by ORGADMIN.\n\nSnowflake Cortex vector functions for semantic distance calculations along with VECTOR as a data type enabled."

LetÂ´s start by getting a few documents locally and then create a database that will hold the PDFs, the functions that will process (extract and chunk) those PDFs and the table that will hold the text embeddings.\n\n### Step 1. Download example documents\n\nLet's download a few documents we have created about bikes. In those documents we have added some very specific information about those ficticious models. You can always add more or use a different type of documents that you want to try asking questions against. At the end we are going to test how the LLM responds with and without access to the information in the documents.\n\n- [Mondracer Infant Bike](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfquickstarts/blob/master/site/sfguides/src/ask-questions-to-your-documents-using-rag-with-snowflake-cortex/assets/Mondracer_Infant_Bike.pdf?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O)\n- [Premium Bycycle User Guide](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfquickstarts/blob/master/site/sfguides/src/ask-questions-to-your-documents-using-rag-with-snowflake-cortex/assets/Premium_Bicycle_User_Guide.pdf?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O)\n- [Ski Boots TDBootz Special](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfquickstarts/blob/master/site/sfguides/src/ask-questions-to-your-documents-using-rag-with-snowflake-cortex/assets/Ski_Boots_TDBootz_Special.pdf?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O)\n- [The Ultimate Downhill Bike](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfquickstarts/blob/master/site/sfguides/src/ask-questions-to-your-documents-using-rag-with-snowflake-cortex/assets/The_Ultimate_Downhill_Bike.pdf?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O)\n\n### Step 2.

Uncheck to see how LLM answers without access to the context.\n\nTo test out the RAG framework, here a few questions you can ask and then use the interactive widgets to compare the results when using a different LLM or when choosing to get a response without the context. This is related to very specific information that we have added into the documents and that is very unique to our products.\n\n- Is there any special lubricant to be used with the premium bike?\n- What is the warranty for the premium bike?\n- Does the mondracer infant bike need any special tool?\n- Is there any temperature to be considered with the premium bicycle?\n- What is the temperature to store the ski boots?\n- Where have the ski boots been tested and who tested them?\n\n### Other things to test\n\nIn this example we have just decided a fixed format for chunks and used only the top result in the retrieval process. This [blog](https://medium.com/@thechosentom/rag-made-simple-with-snowflake-cortex-74d1df5143fd) provides some considerations about settings in the chunking function in our Snowpark UDTF."

   "source": "## 5. Build a ChatBot UI that Remember Previous Conversations\n\nIn the previous section we have created a simple interface where we can ask questions about our documents and select the LLM running within Snowflake Cortex to answer the question. We have seen that when no context from our documents is provided, we just get a general answer, versus a specific answer related to our documents when we use context from the PDFs. But what if we want to have a conversation sytle?\n\nStreamlit makes it very easy to create chat interfaces with its [Chat Elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/chat?_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O&_fsi=P4Dy8V0O). In this section we are going to see how we can write a simple app that can be used to have a conversation, and how it uses the data from our documents to provide answers.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are stateless. That means when we make a call to any of them, it does not remember what the previous call was about. With Snowflake Cortex, each complete() call we make is independent, even when using the same model. There are several techniques that can be used to keep the conversation flow and do not forget the chat history. In summary, the app needs to keep a memory of the conversation and provide it in each call to the LLM. As we know, calls to LLMs are restricted by the context window length that can be used.\n\nIn this lab, we are going to use a slide window concept. This helps to remember just a number of past interactions when calling the LLM. We are also going to summarize the previous conversation in order to find the right chunk in our documents that will help the LLM and provide the right answer. In the previous section, we were embedding the new question to find the right chunk for context. Here, we are going to also include the previous summary to find the chunks that will be used as context.\n\nFirst letÂ´s create the new Streamlit App and then we will discuss each of the steps. Give it a name and create it within the database and schema that we are using in this lab (CC_QUICKSTART_CORTEX_DOCS.DATA) or whatever name you may have chosen.\n\nThe Streamlit app comes with a default template you can delete and replace with this code which includes the front-end elements:"
